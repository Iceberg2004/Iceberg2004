        /*
        TIME COMPLEXITY

          Big O notation
            It provides the upper bound or worst time complexity
          
          Theta 0 notaion
            it provides the avg time complexity giving the upper as well as lower bound

          omega notation
            it provides best time complexity or lower bound 

        SPACE COMPLEXITY

            the space taken by the algo + the auxillary space taken by the input data is called time complexity

            There are two types of recursions
            1.Linear
            2.Divide and conquer

            TO ACTUALLY FET TEH TIME COMPLEX. OF AN ALOGO THEN USE
            AKRA BAAZI FORMULA GIVEN BY TWO STUDENS OF MIT
